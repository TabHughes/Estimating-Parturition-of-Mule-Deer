### The code in this repository was used to estimate timing and frequency of parturition for mule deer as part of a study described in "Evaluating movement-based methods for estimating the frequency and timing of parturition in mule deer", by Tabitha A. Hughes, Randy T. Larsen, Kent R. Hersey, Madelon van de Kerk, and Brock R. McMillan. DOI: 10.1186/s40462-024-00450-4
